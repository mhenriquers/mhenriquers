## About me

I am a Systems Analysis and Development student, currently in my 5th semester, with hands-on experience in Python, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, and UML modeling. I have intermediate English skills and a background as a veteran of the Brazilian Army, which has instilled in me a high level of discipline, focus, and responsibility. I am actively seeking internship opportunities in the tech industry where I can apply my technical knowledge to practical and challenging environments.
